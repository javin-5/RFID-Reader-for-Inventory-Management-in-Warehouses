# RFID-Reader-for-Inventory-Management-in-Warehouses
 Our goal is to design an UHF RFID Reader that can detect tags up to a distance of 2 meters.  While  designing the RFID Reader, we have to design an antenna to detect tags that go through portals in  warehouses to keep track of inventory. 
Our work mainly comprises of the PCB design and the antenna design. It is quite a challenge for us since this project falls under RF and microwave engineering which is an area that is new to us. We took this challenge upon ourselves to take up on this project and see it to the very end. Since this project is still ongoing I have included the Design Documentation report that contains all the work done upto date.
